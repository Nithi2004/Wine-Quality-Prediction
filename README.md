## Project Description

The **Wine Quality Prediction** project aims to predict the quality of wine based on a dataset that includes several chemical features. It utilizes a trained machine learning model (`XGBoost classifier`) for predictions. The project consists of:

- **Frontend:** A user-friendly interface for uploading wine data, managing purchase orders, and interacting with the backend.
- **Backend:** A RESTful API that processes incoming wine data, runs predictions, and returns the results.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:**
  - React
  - Tailwind CSS
  - Axios (for API calls)
  
- **Backend:**
  - Python
  - Flask
  - XGBoost (for the wine quality prediction model)
  - Pandas (for data processing)

- **Others:**
  - Git (version control)
  - Docker (for containerization)
  - GitHub (for hosting the code)
